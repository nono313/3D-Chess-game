####Objective
A special version of the classic chess game is often played by the characters of the Star Trek franchise in movies and tv series.<br>
This is an implementation in Java of this board game.<br>
It is played like a normal chess game despite the presence of multiple boards.<br>

####Implementation
This project was part of an initiation course on object-oriented programming.<br>
It was developped in Java with the Swing librairy.<br>
When coding the project, we tried to respect the MVC pattern by using interfaces to link the view, the controller and the model.<br>

####Features
* Multiplayer functionality
* Random bots are available, either for one or for both players
* Saving the current game to an XML file and restore it.
* Move of the attack boards (see the Rules.txt)
